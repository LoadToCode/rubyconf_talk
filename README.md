============

This little repo is based on https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/RGSoC_slides.git and contains the slides and images for our joint presentation.

How to go about this? Well... ```git clone``` this repo and use it for your own purposes.
Or just download the files: `2016_example_slides.pdf` or `talk_the_talk.ppt`. Feel free to create your own from the pdf example (and make a PR if you want to add it to this repo for other students to use).  

about Rails Girls Summer of Code you can find more detailed information, links to videos, and some photos on our [press page](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/about/press/).  

And now #CodeGrrrl !
